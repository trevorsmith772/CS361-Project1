# Project X: Project Name

* Author: Your Name
* Class: CS121 Section X
* Semester: Spring 2016

## Overview

Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple of
sentences, you're going too far. Generally you should be pulling this
right from the project specification. I don't want you to just cut and
paste, but paraphrase what is stated in the project specification.

## Compiling and Using

This section should tell the user how to compile your code.  It is
also appropriate to instruct the user how to use your code. Does your
program require user input? If so, what does your user need to know
about it to use it as quickly as possible?

## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.
  * What problems did you have? What went well?
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  of working on this project?
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?

## Testing

In this section, tell us how you tested your project.

You are expected to test your projects before submitting them for
final review. Pretend that your instructor is your manager or 
customer at work. How would you ensure that you are delivering a 
working solution to their requirements?

## Extra Credit

If the project had opportunities for extra credit that you attempted,
be sure to call it out so the grader does not overlook it.

## Sources used

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files,
or text book you need to list them here. If you looked something up on
stackoverflow.com and fail to cite it in this section it will be
considered plagiarism and be dealt with accordingly. So be safe CITE!
