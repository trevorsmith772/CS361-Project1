# Project 1: Deterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Trevor Smith, Brandon Mattaini, Berto Cisneros
* Class: CS 361, Section 1 (Trevor & Berto), Section 2 (Brandon)
* Semester: Spring 2021



## Overview

This program is an implementation of a deterministic finite automaton. The program takes in a file and reads the states, alphabet, and transitions, and determines whether specific input strings are valid or not.

## Compiling and Using

In order to compile this program, make sure you are in the parent directory containing this README file. Once you are at this directory, run the command shown below to compile the whole package:

javac -cp . fa/dfa/DFADriver.java

Then to run the program, run the following command, where <input file> is the file (and filepath) that the program will run.

java fa/dfa/DFADriver <input file>

## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.
  * What problems did you have? What went well?
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  of working on this project?
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?

## Testing

In this section, tell us how you tested your project.

You are expected to test your projects before submitting them for
final review. Pretend that your instructor is your manager or 
customer at work. How would you ensure that you are delivering a 
working solution to their requirements?

## Extra Credit

If the project had opportunities for extra credit that you attempted,
be sure to call it out so the grader does not overlook it.

## Sources used

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files,
or text book you need to list them here. If you looked something up on
stackoverflow.com and fail to cite it in this section it will be
considered plagiarism and be dealt with accordingly. So be safe CITE!
