# Project 1: Deterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Trevor Smith, Brandon Mattaini, Berto Cisneros
* Class: CS 361, Section 1 (Trevor & Berto), Section 2 (Brandon)
* Semester: Spring 2021



## Overview

This program is an implementation of a deterministic finite automaton. The program takes in a file and reads the states, alphabet, and transitions, and determines whether specific input strings are valid or not.

## Compiling and Using

In order to compile this program, make sure you are in the parent directory containing this README file. Once you are at this directory, run the command shown below to compile the whole package:

javac -cp . fa/dfa/DFADriver.java

Then to run the program, run the following command, where <input file> is the file (and filepath) that the program will run.

java fa/dfa/DFADriver <input file>

## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.
  * What problems did you have? What went well?
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  of working on this project?
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?

## Testing

For testing this project, we compiled and ran the DFADriver class with the 3 given test files
to be able to compare our results. If we found any issues with our code we would run
the other two tests to see if they contained the same problems and we went from there.
We were able to match the correct output for all 3 tests provided to us.
